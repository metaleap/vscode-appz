            The workspace offers support for [listening](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#workspace.createFileSystemWatcher) to fs
            events and for [finding](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#workspace.findFiles) files. Both perform well and run _outside_
            the editor-process so that they should be always used instead of nodejs-equivalents.

        <member name="P:VscAppz.IVscode.Languages">
            <summary>
            Namespace for participating in language-specific editor [features](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved),
            like IntelliSense, code actions, diagnostics etc.
            
            Many programming languages exist and there is huge variety in syntaxes, semantics, and paradigms. Despite that, features
            like automatic word-completion, code navigation, or code checking have become popular across different tools for different
            programming languages.
            
            The editor provides an API that makes it simple to provide such common features by having all UI and actions already in place and
            by allowing you to participate by providing data only. For instance, to contribute a hover all you have to do is provide a function
            that can be called with a [TextDocument](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#TextDocument) and a [Position](#Position) returning hover info. The rest, like tracking the
            mouse, positioning the hover, keeping the hover stable etc. is taken care of by the editor.
            
            
            ```javascript
            
            languages.registerHoverProvider('javascript', {
             	provideHover(document, position, token) {
             		return new Hover('I am a hover!');
             	}
            });
            
            ```
            
            
            Registration is done using a [document selector](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#DocumentSelector) which is either a language id, like `javascript` or
            a more complex [filter](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#DocumentFilter) like `{ language: 'typescript', scheme: 'file' }`. Matching a document against such
            a selector will result in a [score](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#languages.match) that is used to determine if and how a provider shall be used. When
            scores are equal the provider that came last wins. For features that allow full arity, like [hover](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#languages.registerHoverProvider),
            the score is only checked to be `>0`, for other features, like [IntelliSense](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#languages.registerCompletionItemProvider) the
            score is used for determining the order in which providers are asked to participate.

        <member name="P:VscAppz.IVscode.Extensions">
            <summary>
            Namespace for dealing with installed extensions. Extensions are represented
            by an [extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#Extension)-interface which enables reflection on them.
            
            Extension writers can provide APIs to other extensions by returning their API public
            surface from the `activate`-call.
            
            
            ```javascript
            
            export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
             	let api = {
             		sum(a, b) {
             			return a + b;
             		},
             		mul(a, b) {
             			return a * b;
             		}
             	};
             	// 'export' public api-surface
             	return api;
            }
            
            ```
            
            When depending on the API of another extension add an `extensionDependency`-entry
            to `package.json`, and use the [getExtension](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#extensions.getExtension)-function
            and the [exports](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#Extension.exports)-property, like below:
            
            
            ```javascript
            
            let mathExt = extensions.getExtension('genius.math');
            let importedApi = mathExt.exports;
            
            console.log(importedApi.mul(42, 1));
            
            ```

        <member name="P:VscAppz.IVscode.Commands">
            <summary>
            Namespace for dealing with commands. In short, a command is a function with a
            unique identifier. The function is sometimes also called _command handler_.
            
            Commands can be added to the editor using the [registerCommand](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#commands.registerCommand)
            and [registerTextEditorCommand](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#commands.registerTextEditorCommand) functions. Commands
            can be executed [manually](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#commands.executeCommand) or from a UI gesture. Those are:
            
            * palette - Use the `commands`-section in `package.json` to make a command show in
            the [command palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette).
            * keybinding - Use the `keybindings`-section in `package.json` to enable
            [keybindings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings#_customizing-shortcuts)
            for your extension.
            
            Commands from other extensions and from the editor itself are accessible to an extension. However,
            when invoking an editor command not all argument types are supported.
            
            This is a sample that registers a command handler and adds an entry for that command to the palette. First
            register a command handler with the identifier `extension.sayHello`.
            
            ```javascript
            
            commands.registerCommand('extension.sayHello', () => {
             	window.showInformationMessage('Hello World!');
            });
            
            ```
            
            Second, bind the command identifier to a title under which it will show in the palette (`package.json`).
            
            ```json
            
            {
             	"contributes": {
             		"commands": [{
             			"command": "extension.sayHello",
             			"title": "Hello World"
             		}]
             	}
            }
            
            ```

            The workspace offers support for [listening](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#workspace.createFileSystemWatcher) to fs
            events and for [finding](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#workspace.findFiles) files. Both perform well and run _outside_

            `file:///Users/name/Development/myProject.code-workspace`
            
            or
            
            `untitled:1555503116870`
            
            for a workspace that is untitled and not yet saved.
            
            Depending on the workspace that is opened, the value will be:
              * `undefined` when no workspace or  a single folder is opened
              * the path of the workspace file as `Uri` otherwise. if the workspace
            is untitled, the returned URI will use the `untitled:` scheme
            
            The location can e.g. be used with the `vscode.openFolder` command to
            open the workspace again after it has been closed.
            
            **Example:**
            
            ```typescript
            
            vscode.commands.executeCommand('vscode.openFolder', uriOfWorkspace);
            
            ```
            
            
            **Note:** it is not advised to use `workspace.workspaceFile` to write
            configuration data into the file. You can use `workspace.getConfiguration().update()`
            for that purpose which will work both when a single folder is opened as
            well as an untitled or saved workspace.

            Namespace for participating in language-specific editor [features](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved),
            like IntelliSense, code actions, diagnostics etc.
            
            Many programming languages exist and there is huge variety in syntaxes, semantics, and paradigms. Despite that, features
            like automatic word-completion, code navigation, or code checking have become popular across different tools for different
            programming languages.
            
            The editor provides an API that makes it simple to provide such common features by having all UI and actions already in place and
            by allowing you to participate by providing data only. For instance, to contribute a hover all you have to do is provide a function
            that can be called with a [TextDocument](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#TextDocument) and a [Position](#Position) returning hover info. The rest, like tracking the
            mouse, positioning the hover, keeping the hover stable etc. is taken care of by the editor.
            
            
            ```javascript
            
            languages.registerHoverProvider('javascript', {
             	provideHover(document, position, token) {
             		return new Hover('I am a hover!');
             	}
            });
            
            ```
            
            
            Registration is done using a [document selector](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#DocumentSelector) which is either a language id, like `javascript` or
            a more complex [filter](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#DocumentFilter) like `{ language: 'typescript', scheme: 'file' }`. Matching a document against such
            a selector will result in a [score](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#languages.match) that is used to determine if and how a provider shall be used. When
            scores are equal the provider that came last wins. For features that allow full arity, like [hover](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#languages.registerHoverProvider),
            the score is only checked to be `>0`, for other features, like [IntelliSense](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#languages.registerCompletionItemProvider) the
            score is used for determining the order in which providers are asked to participate.

            Extension writers can provide APIs to other extensions by returning their API public
            surface from the `activate`-call.
            
            
            ```javascript
            
            export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {

            <summary>
            Namespace for dealing with commands. In short, a command is a function with a
            unique identifier. The function is sometimes also called _command handler_.
            
            Commands can be added to the editor using the [registerCommand](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#commands.registerCommand)
            and [registerTextEditorCommand](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#commands.registerTextEditorCommand) functions. Commands
            can be executed [manually](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#commands.executeCommand) or from a UI gesture. Those are:
            
            * palette - Use the `commands`-section in `package.json` to make a command show in
            the [command palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette).
            * keybinding - Use the `keybindings`-section in `package.json` to enable
            [keybindings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings#_customizing-shortcuts)
            for your extension.
            
            Commands from other extensions and from the editor itself are accessible to an extension. However,
            when invoking an editor command not all argument types are supported.
            
            This is a sample that registers a command handler and adds an entry for that command to the palette. First
            register a command handler with the identifier `extension.sayHello`.
            
            ```javascript
            
            commands.registerCommand('extension.sayHello', () => {
             	window.showInformationMessage('Hello World!');
            });
            
            ```
            
            Second, bind the command identifier to a title under which it will show in the palette (`package.json`).
            
            ```json
            
            {
             	"contributes": {
             		"commands": [{
             			"command": "extension.sayHello",
             			"title": "Hello World"
             		}]
             	}
            }

            The location of the workspace file, for example:
            
            `file:///Users/name/Development/myProject.code-workspace`
            
            or
            
            `untitled:1555503116870`
            
            for a workspace that is untitled and not yet saved.
            
            Depending on the workspace that is opened, the value will be:
              * `undefined` when no workspace or  a single folder is opened
              * the path of the workspace file as `Uri` otherwise. if the workspace
            is untitled, the returned URI will use the `untitled:` scheme
            
            The location can e.g. be used with the `vscode.openFolder` command to
            open the workspace again after it has been closed.
            
            **Example:**
            
            ```typescript
            
            vscode.commands.executeCommand('vscode.openFolder', uriOfWorkspace);
            
            ```
            
            
            **Note:** it is not advised to use `workspace.workspaceFile` to write
            configuration data into the file. You can use `workspace.getConfiguration().update()`
            for that purpose which will work both when a single folder is opened as
            well as an untitled or saved workspace.
